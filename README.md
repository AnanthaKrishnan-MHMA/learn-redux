# Redux Toolkit and Redux Thunk
## This project was created to learn 'Redux Toolkit'
In react the state is distributed in a singular direction. i.e; from parent to child.
This data is lost when user switch between different components. But by using Redux toolkit we 
can create create a global state locally. This global state or store lets all the components 
extract data from it, at the same time maintaining the data without loosing it.

In this project I've created each component with and without Redux Toolkit,
for the purpose of demonstrating its usefullness.
